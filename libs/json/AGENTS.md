# JSON codec performance notes

The hand-written codecs in `json-core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/varlanv/koper/json/tmp` are the performance reference.
Do not change them while building the generator.

## Writing

- Plan output field order for capacity reservation, independently of constructor or declaration order. Separate fields
  with a compile-time maximum byte count (for example integer, boolean, encoded field name), fields whose maximum can be
  calculated once from the value at write time (`String`, `Utf8Str`), and fields with no known maximum (for example an
  arbitrary `Iterable`). Place the bounded fields in one contiguous run, at the start or end, so one reservation can
  cover that run; write unbounded fields through checked, streaming operations. The current `NativeJsonUtf8Codec`
  demonstrates the all-bounded case; a mixed case still needs to be implemented and measured.
- For strings, budget the worst-case escaped size: `2 + 6 * String.length` or `2 + 6 * Utf8Str.bytes.len` including
  quotes. Control bytes can expand to six ASCII bytes. Add fixed punctuation, field names, numeric maxima, and booleans
  to the object bound. Do the arithmetic in `Long`, then check the supported `Int`/buffer limit before converting.
  `NativeJsonUtf8Codec` uses `87L + 6L * symbol.length + 6L * text.bytes.len` for its exact shape.
- `IdealJsonWriter.reserveObject` ensures contiguous capacity before the reserved write methods. `writeRawReserved`,
  `writeLongReserved`, `writeIntReserved`, `writeStringReserved`, and `writeUtf8Reserved` then avoid repeated capacity
  checks. Their callers must prove the reservation covers every byte; these methods do not check it. The native codec
  takes this path only up to its 32 KiB object limit, then switches to checked, streaming writes. Preserve a large-value
  path instead of allocating an arbitrarily large temporary writer buffer.
- Emit fixed JSON fragments as packed bytes where the reference does, rather than rebuilding field names at runtime.
  Decimal integer writes use packed three-digit groups. `writeRaw` sends large byte slices directly to the output. The
  writer and output can be reset and reused.

## Reading

- Input field order is independent of write order. The reference reader dispatches common names with packed-word
  comparisons, then falls back to a field-name hash **and byte equality check**. Unknown values are skipped; a `seen`
  bitset checks required fields. Preserve the full-name check because hashes can collide.
- `IdealJsonReader` buffers input and handles values split across buffer boundaries. Its string fast path scans until
  quote, backslash, or control byte; escaped or split strings use reusable scratch storage. `readLongReserved` and
  `readIntReserved` attempt contiguous parsing and fall back when insufficient input remains. The scalar and vector JSON
  scanners are selected through `JsonSpecialScan`; JVM vector code is guarded by `VectorApi`, while JS uses scalar
  scanning.

## Reuse and measurement

- Use existing KMP utilities: `lang/bin/Bytes.kt` for byte slices and packed stores, `lang/text/Strings.kt` and
  `Charsets.kt` for UTF-8, and `json-core/PackedJsonBytes.kt` plus platform `JsonPlatform.*.kt` for JSON word loads and
  special-byte scanning. Do not copy the JVM-only vector implementation into common code.
- For reusable performance utilities that are not unique to JSON encoding, consider putting them in `lang` module and
  testing/benchmarking separately.
